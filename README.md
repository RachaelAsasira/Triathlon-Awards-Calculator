# Triathlon-Awards-Calculator
This repository contains a Python program that calculates the total time taken to complete a triathlon based on the individual times for swimming, cycling, and running events. Additionally, it determines the award that a participant will receive based on their total time according to specific criteria:

Provincial Colours: Awarded for completing the triathlon within 100 minutes.

Provincial Half Colours: Awarded for completing the triathlon within 101-105 minutes.

Provincial Scroll: Awarded for completing the triathlon within 106-110 minutes.

No award: Awarded if the total time exceeds 110 minutes.

This program serves as a useful tool for both triathletes and event organizers to quickly assess and recognize participants' performances in a triathlon. It's easy to use and can be customized for various triathlon events.
